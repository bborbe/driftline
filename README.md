# driftline

Private Trackmania-like browser racing game. Vite + TypeScript + three.js (WebGPU, WebGL2 fallback).

```bash
make run        # dev server (installs deps if needed); drive: WASD / arrows, Space = handbrake; ?renderer=webgl2 forces WebGL2
make test
make build
```

See `VISION.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Cars

The player car is picked at build time from the registry in `src/render/cars.ts`:

```bash
VITE_CAR=stadium make build   # race (default) | stadium | raceFuture | box
```

An unknown id falls back to `box`. New entries must use CC0, CC-BY or MIT assets with their licence under `assets/LICENSES/`, and must never be Nadeo-derived.

## Debug screenshots

- `?track=lap2&x=-108&y=0.8&z=-59&yaw=90` spawns the car at that pose (yaw in degrees, 0 = +z, CCW positive). Without all four params the car spawns at the start line as usual. The HUD shows the current `yaw` in the same convention; press `P` to copy the current pose as a full `?track&x&y&z&yaw&freeze=1` URL (a toast confirms).
- `&freeze=1` holds physics and the countdown and hides the Begin overlay, so the frame is stable. Add `&renderer=webgl2` in headless browsers (headless WebGPU renders blank).
- `make shots` (`npm run shots [-- lap1 lap2]`, env `STEP=20`, `OUT=shots`) starts a Vite dev server, walks each lap's centreline every `STEP` metres and writes `shots/<lap>/NNN.png` (gitignored). First run: `npx playwright install chromium-headless-shell`.
