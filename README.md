# driftline

Private Trackmania-like browser racing game. Vite + TypeScript + three.js (WebGPU, WebGL2 fallback).

```bash
make run        # dev server (installs deps if needed); drive: WASD / arrows, Space = handbrake; ?renderer=webgl2 forces WebGL2
make test
make build
```

See `VISION.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Cars

The player car is picked at build time from the registry in `src/render/cars.ts`:

```bash
VITE_CAR=stadium make build   # race (default) | stadium | raceFuture | box
```

An unknown id falls back to `box`. New entries must use CC0, CC-BY or MIT assets with their licence under `assets/LICENSES/`, and must never be Nadeo-derived.

## Deploy

Every merge to `master` builds and deploys to https://bborbe.github.io/driftline/ via `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (GitHub Pages, source: GitHub Actions). The deployed commit SHA is in the page's `<meta name="commit">` tag.
